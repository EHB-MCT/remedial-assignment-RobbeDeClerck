# üß† Unity Game: Data Aggregation & Visualisation

This Unity project is developed to implement **data aggregation** and **visualize player data** in the context of three well-established **human cognitive tasks**. Its purpose is to **benchmark and analyze human decision-making** under both normal and challenging conditions by studying reaction, memory, attention, and perception. 

The collected data aims to help researchers and developers **understand how players make decisions**, identify patterns in cognitive performance, and inform improvements in design, training, or adaptive systems.

## üéÆ Player Controls

| Input Key | Action              |
|-----------|---------------------|

# üîä Audio Requirement Disclaimer

This project **requires audio playback** for certain cognitive tasks, specifically the **Auditory Memory** challenge.  
Players must ensure that their device‚Äôs sound is **enabled and functional** in order to successfully complete all tasks.  
Using headphones is recommended for the best experience and to avoid missing important auditory cues.

## üß† Purpose & Key Metrics

This project studies **player responses to cognitive challenges** using tasks that demand focus, memory, inhibition, and perception. The data collected is used to:

- Evaluate **cognitive performance** under time or complexity pressure
- Benchmark **normal vs. hard difficulty performance**
- Investigate **choice behavior** and task-switching strategies

### üîç Key Metrics Collected:

| Metric                       | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚è±Ô∏è **Reaction Time**         | Time taken to respond to stimuli (measured in ms)                          |
| üéß **Auditory Memory**       | Performance on sound-based sequences                |
| üëÄ **Visual Attention**      | Accuracy and focus on visual elements (e.g., colors/locations)             |
| üìà **Task Performance**      | Overall task completion accuracy, speed, and decision paths                |

## üìä Data Flow

This project uses a **structured data flow** to capture, store, and visualize player performance in cognitive tasks:

```plaintext
[Player Input] 
    ‚Üì
[Task Controller + Metrics Recorder]
    ‚Üì
[Firebase SDK (Realtime Database)]
    ‚Üì
[Cloud Storage]
    ‚Üì
[Unity Data Fetcher]
    ‚Üì
[In-Game Visualisation]
```

### üîÅ Description of Flow:

- **Player Input:** The player interacts with cognitive tasks via keyboard and mouse.
- **Task Controller:** Runs the logic and flow of each task (Reaction Time, Auditory Memory and Visual Perception)
- **Metric Recorder:** Captures timestamps, correctness, accuracy, reaction time, and other KPIs. 
- **Firebase SDK:** Sends data to a cloud database (Realtime Database) 
- **Cloud Storage:** Securely stores user performance data (see task controller) with timestamps and a unique user ID.
- **Unity Data Fetcher:** Pulls historical or session data from Firebase when needed.
- **Visualization:** Displays data in Unity (performance summary at the end of the tests), allowing players or researchers to view trends and compare sessions.

## üß† Cognitive Tasks Overview

| Task      | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reaction Time** | Measures cognitive performance based on reaction time                    |
| **Auditory Memory** | Tests working memory by recalling audio spoken messages             |
| **Visual Perception**  | Evaluates response inhibition through color-position matching challenges   |

# üìà Data Visualization (In-Game Summary)

Instead of using external graphing tools, this project displays **player performance data directly in the Unity UI** after each task.

### üìä How It Works

- After completing all tasks, a **summary screen** appears
- Shows **aggregated stats**:
  - Reaction time (average, fastest, slowest)
  - Correct/incorrect responses
  - Task-specific metrics (e.g., accuracy)

> All data is also synced to Firebase for longitudinal analysis or external use if needed.
